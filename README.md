I love making data useful to people!
My skills are best in data manipulation, systems administration/engineering, and untangling complicated data/lineages.

Recently I've been busy with work and starting graduate school but thankfully I'm back in a position where I can start updating my projects again.
Keep an eye out for new content and check out [my resume](https://ctmartin.dev/resume) in the meantime.
If you're intersted in something I haven't posted yet, send me an email and I'll be happy to talk!

Outside of work and school I enjoy tea, immersive experiences, and my data side-hobby is datasets of cultural institutions.
