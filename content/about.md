title: About
---
I love making data useful to people! My skills are best in data manipulation, systems administration/engineering, and untangling complicated data/lineages.

Most recently, I started graduate school at The University of Texas at Austin for a Masters of Science in Information Studies, with a specialization in Data Science.

Previously, I was the Collections Information Specialist at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, where I worked on projects cleaning and repairing metadata in SQL and managing the data pipeline to the website.

For programming, I float between the JavaScript, Python, Linux, and SQL ecosystems. I have experience with a variety of frameworks and tools.

Outside of work and school I enjoy tea, immersive experiences, and my data side-hobby is datasets of cultural institutions.

I'm a recent grad from RIT (BS New Media Interative Development 2020). I minored in Museum Studies, focusing on how people use technology to engage with culture. My tech interests include metadata, visualization, and rich content editing.

Over the last year-ish I've been working with data visualization and semantic markup. This has included visualizing everything from pancakes to museum collections to APIs. I've also been learning about the semantics discussions involved in Schema.org and Markdown.

Some of the tools I've been actively using over the last year include TypeScript, SASS, Nuxt, Hugo, GitLab CI, and d3.

In my free time I've been cooking/baking and experimenting with food.
