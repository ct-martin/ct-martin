I create experiences that take data and make it useful to people.
I have a particular interest in datasets based on human experiences, such as cultural collections and people-driven processes, as well as looking at why things happen and the impact of decisions based on data.

💻 Interests include:
* 📑 metadata
* 📈 [visualization](/vis/)
* 🖊️ rich content editing
* 🏛 [museums & cultural institutions](/vis/museums/)
* 🥞 [food](/food/)
