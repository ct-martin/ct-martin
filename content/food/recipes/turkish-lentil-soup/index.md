## Notes

### Cooking
* I find it cooks better if you put the thicker ingredients like carrots and onion at the bottom
* I like toasting some garlic naan (or other flatbread) olive oil as a side
  * Note: this can make **a lot** of smoke; open some windows

### Ingredients
* Lemon & mint garnish is definitely worthwhile
* I find peppermint works really well; spearmint not so much
* I don't add salt out of preference
* Vegetable broth can be replaced with a vegetable stock, you'll just get a stronger flavor
  * I've used "Thai Culinary Stock" before and omitted the garnish
* Red lentils taste better than green lentils in my opinion
  * Green lentils are more earthy and don't have the same flavor complexity in this dish
  * Green lentils don't break apart as nicely as red lentils; cooking time may vary
  * If you use green lentils you definitely want to add some salt

## Derivation & Modifications
Original recipe: https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/recipes/turkish-style-red-lentil-soup

* 8 cups of broth instead of 7 (uses two boxes exactly)
* Replace the onions with one large spanish onion
* Explicitly write in preferences from the ingredient notes above

## Reheating

This recipe makes a lot (yay!), but roommates, it won't taste as good if you don't garnish it.

1. Take out of fridge
2. Put in bowl
3. Heat in microwave, 3-5min-ish
    * It's ok if you get a strange foamy mesh thing on the top, it mixes back in without issue
    * Tastes better if you make it hot and let it cool than if you don't heat it enough
4. Add 1-2tsp-ish of lemon juice (depending on how much you put in bowl)
5. Rinse 2 large/4 medium mint leaves and put in bowl
6. Eat with naan
    * To keep naan moist, lightly spread water on both sides before microwaving
